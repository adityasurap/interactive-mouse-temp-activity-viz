    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      MouseWatch was created in order for users to explore how body temperature, along with activity levels, differ between male/female mice over time. The interactive visualization was based on data collected from an observational experiment in which the body temperature/activity levels of mice (of both genders) were recorded to the minute. To ensure the mice maintained body clock rhythms, the lighting in the environment was adjusted every twelve hours; the first twelve hours of each day consisted of no lighting, to simulate nighttime, while the second twelve hours of each day consisted of lighting, to simulate daytime. The overall goal was to enable users to identify trends in the data, such as whether male or female mice experience higher body temperatures during each lighting period, whether male or female mice experience higher activity levels during each lighting period, the peak body temperature or activity level for each gender, and much more. By providing an interactive, intuitive way to explore these trends, MouseWatch empowers users to uncover meaningful insights into the biological rhythms of mice, which could be useful for future research.

    <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
    <h3>Development Process</h3>
    <p>
      The majority of the work for this project was done via one computer in person. This includes the majority of the design process, intial templating, and implementation. We sketched out our initial ideas on a online web paint app, and after that, began to create our visualization. After that period, the remaining work was done remotely, mostly covering small changes to the design, encodings, and visualizations. Overall, this project took us roughly ~15 hours, with the brunt of the time spent on getting the visualization to look the way we had prototyped it, and fiddling around with the D3 library.
